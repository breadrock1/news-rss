      <content>The Secret Train Evacuating Wounded Ukrainian Soldiers</content>
      <content>Nearly three years after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, many medical facilities in war-battered eastern Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed.</content>

      <content>Olena, a military medic, checks on injured Ukrainian soldiers on a military evacuation train.</content>
      <content>It looks like an ordinary train waiting to depart an ordinary station, but through its fogged windows, a Ukrainian serviceman with face injuries lies stretched out on a gurney.</content>
      <content>All of the other blue-and-yellow carriages of this train operated by the military are carrying wounded soldiers to hospitals away from the precarious front line.</content>
      <content>For Oleksandr, the army doctor overseeing the evacuation, there are clear benefits to rail: many people can be moved at once and it is safer than transporting wounded soldiers by helicopter, given Russian superiority in Ukraine's airspace.</content>
      <content>But there are risks too.</content>
      <content>Our adversary in the war does not distinguish between what's medical and military, so we take certain security measures,</content>
      <content>said the 46-year-old.</content>
      <content>AFP was recently granted rare media access to the train, whose points of departure and arrival are not being disclosed for security reasons.</content>

      <content>Everything on the move</content>
      <content>Ambulances arrived at the station carrying dozens of wounded troops who were then hauled onto the train on stretchers and settled on beds with floral-patterned sheets.</content>
      <content>Ukrainian flags and hand-drawn pictures by children annotated with patriotic messages lined the walls inside the train.</content>
      <content>The carriages resemble a hospital until the train rolls away from the platform and gently rocks patients and staff -- and everything else inside -- as it crawls farther from the front.</content>
      <content>We do everything on the move, everything. Starting from the usual intravenous injections, ending with incubations,</content>
      <content>said Viktorya, a nurse dressed in khaki and wearing blue medical gloves.</content>
      <content>We get dizzy afterwards,</content>
      <content>the 25-year-old said, standing in front of a window, the sweeping Ukrainian landscape rolling by.</content>
      <content>The journeys to and from the front, where Ukraine is coming under increasing pressure, have given Viktorya a painful insight into the cost of the conflict grinding through its third year.</content>
      <content>I understand the number of wounded now. It's very hard to see it every day,</content>
      <content>she said.</content>

      <content>One Ukrainian serviceman on the train was being treated for a gunshot wound after being caught in a Russian ambush that also killed one of his fellow soldiers.</content>
      <content>Four of us left but not all of us returned,</content>
      <content>said the 28-year-old who identified himself as Murchyk.</content>
      <content>But he was already gauging when he might be able to make his way back to the front, where Ukraine's outnumbered forces have been ceding ground to determined Russian advances.</content>
      <content>Whether Murchyk can return to combat will be decided by a medical commission, but he said he was clear-eyed about his wish.</content>

      <content>The train evacuations in Ukraine began when the war did, in February 2022.</content>
      <content>It revives a process used in World War II, with several refitted trains now taking wounded troops from the front.</content>
      <content>When Oleksandr's train arrives at its destination, ambulances are already waiting for the patients to be loaded off and taken onwards to hospital.</content>
      <content>It is of course very stressful and yes, you breathe a sigh of relief when you arrive and unload,</content>
      <content>he said, "when you see that all the ambulances have left, when the platform is empty and the train is empty."</content>
