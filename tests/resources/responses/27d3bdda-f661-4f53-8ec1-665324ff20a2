      <content>"It looks like an ordinary train waiting to depart an ordinary station, but through its fogged windows, a Ukrainian serviceman with face injuries lies stretched out on a gurney."
      <content>"All of the other blue-and-yellow carriages of this train operated by the military are carrying wounded soldiers to hospitals away from the precarious front line."
      <content>"For Oleksandr, the army doctor overseeing the evacuation, there are clear benefits to rail: many people can be moved at once and it is safer than transporting wounded soldiers by helicopter, given Russian superiority in Ukraine's airspace."
      <content>"But there are risks too."
      <content>"Our adversary in the war does not distinguish between what's medical and military, so we take certain security measures," the 46-year-old said."
      <content>"Everything on the move'"
      <content>"Ambulances arrived at the station carrying dozens of wounded troops who were then hauled onto the train on stretchers and settled on beds with floral-patterned sheets."
      <content>"Ukrainian flags and hand-drawn pictures by children annotated with patriotic messages lined the walls inside the train."
      <content>"The carriages resemble a hospital until the train rolls away from the platform and gently rocks patients and staff -- and everything else inside -- as it crawls farther from the front."
      <content>"Worried about others'"
      <content>"Most of those wounded were struck in artillery or drone attacks, staff explained, and many have had arms or legs amputated or were unconscious."
