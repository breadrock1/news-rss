Japanese toymaker MegaHouse has unveiled a miniature Rubik’s Cube — one so tiny that you might need a pair of tweezers to solve it. Each face of the cube, which is made from aluminum, measures about five millimeters (around 0.2 inches) across. It was made available for pre-order on the manufacturer’s website on Thursday, with deliveries expected next April.
Weighing just 0.3 grams (about 0.01 ounces), the puzzle is about a 1,000th of the size of the original, which measures around 2.2 inches across each face. And each side of the nine squares on the device’s six faces measures just 1.6 millimeters (around 0.06 inches). MegaHouse told CNN that the company started conceptualizing it four years ago and began the process to produce it in 2022.
Guinness World Record confirmed the micro-cube as the world’s smallest rotating puzzle cube in August. The miniature model breaks the record set by British puzzle designer Tony Fisher in 2016, when he startled fans with a 5.6-milimeter version. But the price tag suggests it’s likely to be a collector’s item rather than the kind of cube that players fiddle with on the go.
They are being sold at 777,777 yen ($5,320), and each comes with a stand declaring it the “World’s record smallest Rubik’s Cube.”
